        "Answer Here:Employing context outside of individual words gives strength to tokenization by allowing models to identify words within their context, providing improved performance for tasks like machine translation and question answering. Tokenization without context will incorrectly split multi-word units like \"New York\" or misinterpret such words as \"bank,\" either a bank as in an institution or the riverbank. By being context-aware, tokenization prevents words from being misclassified and wrongly interpreted on the basis of meaning. This is important with languages that have heavily convoluted word construction, such that dismantling words incorrectly would transform their entire meaning. When it comes to machine translation, context helps maintain the correct structure and meaning of sentences across languages. Context interpretation in question-answering systems allows the model to accurately select relevant information. Context-aware tokenization also improves sentence segmentation by distinguishing between abbreviations and actual sentence breaks. Overall, by maintaining word relationships, contextual tokenization improves the accuracy and performance of NLP models."

        "A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex, is a powerful and flexible tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. It consists of a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, allowing you to perform various text-related tasks such as text validation, data extraction, text cleaning, and more. Regular expressions are used in programming languages and text editors and are constructed using a combination of regular characters, special characters, and metacharacters to specify search criteria. Learning to use regular expressions effectively can greatly enhance text processing tasks, making them a valuable skill in fields like natural language processing, data extraction, and data validation."

After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City, Washington proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries. His second Inauguration took place in Philadelphia on March 4, 1793(03/04/1793), in the Senate chamber of Congress Hall. There, Washington gave the shortest Inaugural address on record—just 135 words —before repeating the oath of office.\n",
        "Every President since Washington has delivered an Inaugural address. While many of the early Presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court administer the oath first, followed by the President’s speech.\n",
        "William Henry Harrison delivered the longest Inaugural address, at 8,445 words, on March 4, 1841—a bitterly cold, wet day. He died one month later of pneumonia, believed to have been brought on by prolonged exposure to the elements on his Inauguration Day. John Adams’ Inaugural address, which totaled 2,308 words, contained the longest sentence, at 737 words. After Washington’s second Inaugural address, the next shortest was Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fourth address on January 20, 1945(01-20-1945), at just 559.0 words. Roosevelt had chosen to have a simple Inauguration at the White House in light of the nation’s involvement in World War II.\n",
        "In 1921, Warren G. Harding became the first President to take his oath and deliver his Inaugural address through loud speakers. In 1925, Calvin Coolidge’s Inaugural address was the first to be broadcast nationally by radio. And in 1949, Harry S. Truman became the first President to deliver his Inaugural address over television airwaves.\n",
        "Most Presidents use their Inaugural address to present their vision of America and to set forth their goals for the nation. Some of the most eloquent and powerful speeches are still quoted today. In 1865, in the waning days of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln stated, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt avowed, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself.” And in 1961, John F. Kennedy declared, “And so my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”\n",
        "Today, Presidents deliver their Inaugural address on the West Front of the Capitol, but this has not always been the case. Until Andrew Jackson’s first Inauguration in 1829, most Presidents spoke in either the House or Senate chambers. Jackson became the first President to take his oath of office and deliver his address on the East Front Portico of the U.S. Capitol in 1829. With few exceptions, the next 37.0 Inaugurations took place there, until 1981, when Ronald Reagan’s Swearing-In Ceremony and Inaugural address occurred on the West Front Terrace of the Capitol. The West Front has been used ever since.\"\"\"\n",

        "The morphology of the languages has a significant contribution towards choosing between lemmatization and stemming for text processing. In agglutinative languages like Turkish and Finnish, where affixes are added on top of root words in order to express such categories as tense and case, stemming can be useful because it only strips away affix. But since there can be several affix variations, stemming may not be accurate. Lemmatization, however, looks at the whole shape of the word and can be more accurate in such languages, because it can correctly determine the root shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fusional languages like Spanish and Russian pack several different pieces of grammar into a single affix. Owing to such complexity, stemming becomes ineffective because it may not be able to disjoin root and affix. Lemmatization, however, works best for such languages because it looks for the whole shape of the word and its context, and reduces more exactly to the root."

        "Lemmatization and stop removal are two of the principal natural process techniques for text preprocessing for analysis. Lemmatization normalizes the words into their root forms or their forms from the dictionary for representation. Verbs like \"running\" are normalized into \"run,\" and plurals like \"cats\" into \"cat.\" The process aids text improvement with normalizing varying forms of a word. The stop removal, however, filters frequent occurrence and semantics-negligible terms such as \"the,\" \"are,\" and \"in.\" The terms don't matter for semantics for the majority of the NLP processes and therefore are not considered for enhanced performance. If the two processes are performed, a sentence is normalized into a more compact and significant representation with major content terms. The output has key semantics and ignores extraneous contents, and the text becomes ready for other processes such as classification and searching for data.\n",

        "Minimum Edit Distance (MED) has widespread use in NLP to compute the text sequence similarity as the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one sequence into another. MED in spell check aids in detecting and correcting spelling error by comparing words with a dictionary and providing the most suitable match. In speech recognition, it calculates transcription accuracy by comparing predicted-reference text differences, although other models must be employed where there is phonetic difference. In text summarization, MED is used to calculate similarity between generated and reference summaries, although due to the paraphrasing nature of summarization, it is usually blended with other measures like ROUGE. With machine translation, MED can be used for comparing translations to reference text but does not note differences in meaning and is thus outperformed by BLEU and METEOR. Even though effective under strict text matching, the performance of MED varies with semantic understanding tasks."
